# Rhizome

The aim of this project is to design a completely decentralized platform for
assigning and distributing computing with agreements enforced with Bitcoin
contracts.

## Communication

Communication is carried out through a Distributed Hash Table taking advantage
of the work done by Oskar Sandberg - namely taking advantage of Small World
Networks. Identity is typically hard to enforce in networks like this, so
this project will piggy-back on top of Facebook for authentication.

## Computing

Jobs will be distributed as signed jar files.

Data files will be distributed as signed raw files.

## Agreements

Agreements could be implemented either with OpenAssets or Counterparty contracts.
This mechanism has to be evaluated a bit more before a decision can be made.
